# Setting up the environment 

Welcome. Before you can start with the module, we need to make sure that you and your computer both are ready. Follow these steps 

1. Go to Anaconda Prompt. 
2. Type the following command: 
`conda create -n simvis python=3.6`

**Note that the virtual environment we are creating is in for python 3.6. You may have Anaconda Prompt with maybe version 3.7 or above, do not worry. When specifying `python=3.6` you create an environment with version 3.6 despite whatever version of Anaconda you own**

3. Now download the following wheel files from the google drive folder <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-3R4ecMf1YHQC9D7utkUvrxJEcZNuZYD">here</a>
